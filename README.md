# php-task

First attempt at PHP language. Had a great learning experience. The front end side leaves a lot to be desired, but that was not the focus of this task. Had to rethink/remake the database structure a few times. I'd say most of the pages were easy apart from the "edit_project.php" page, because it required the most database logic. As I come from Python at first I used Python PEP-8 rules, halfway into the project I tried to use the PSR guidelines.
